Key:  Priority L M H (low to high)		Effort   1 2 3 4 5 (easy to hard)

   M Web Full UI - music controller
		H 1 Scrolling text plugin for playing track name
		H 5 Positional "map" of fixtures (with icons showing type and direction) for easy capture
		M 5 Workspace channel management (re-arrange channels, hidden channels, save channel sets)
		M 5 Simplify animations (must be easier to create animations from the UI)
		L 5 Alternative to dialogs
		L 1 Improved error responses (e.g. "<item> not found")
		L 1 Animated running GIFs for chases
		L 1 Handle disconnected server state (disable UI)
		L 2 Authentication & session control
		L 4 Album artwork
		H 4 Music search
		
	L Scene Animations:
		L Movement animation travel time
		L Programs should control travel time rather than fixed signal input
		L Global animations or attached to a fixture
		L Animation speed changes based on beat detection
		L Multiple animations per fixture (deal with channel contention)
		L Pixel Map support (single/multiple fixtures)
		L Loadable, scripted, self contained animations with specific properties (versus the current rat's nest)

	L Sound processing
		M Beat detector scaling, improved detection algorithm, logarithmic scaling
		L Add channel mixing to audio stream class
		L Support format conversion in audio output
		H Improved sound animation affects (currently they are not very exact and are hard to setup)
		L Song blending / beat matching
		M Handle music format changes and other formats

	M Fixtures / Fixture Definitions
		L Simple angle->value options (angle*xx) == DMX code
		L Multiple universes (increase DMX packet size, zero-based universe ID is simply the high byte)
		L Movement speed abstraction
		L Dimmer curve (LEDs can fall off fast at the end)
		L Minimum dimmer setting

	M Code Maintainence
		M Bullet proof error detection and automatic restart
		L Introduce studio fault to kill and restart program (vs error based execeptions)

	L Scene / Chase / Act Improvements
		L Scene selection based on the music beat (BPM)
		L Chase changed based on beat, time or track transition
		L Chase random scene from all/pool
		L Chase crossfade = % of time cues fading into each other (kill fade time change to crossfade model)?
		L Chase learn mode - track time and scene transitions
		L Name acts and easier act selection in UI

	L General Enhancements
		L MIDI fogger control with ready indicator (auto fog timer?)
		L Midi controller support ( tablet support )
		L Fixture duty cycle support?
		L Video support
		? Need real color transforms
	
 	M Test Targets
		Unit tests
		Verify channel remapping works across UI, ACTORS, and ANIMATIONS 
			Seems possible to double map or not map scene actor channels
			Check UI->SceneChannelAnimator and SceneMovementAnimator->SceneChannelAnimator

- Higher level abstraction for fixture behaviors. For Example:
		- ROTATE TO 180
		- PAN TO 180
		- STROBE AT <rate>
		- INTENSITY <intensity>
		- SPECIAL EFFECT <args>
		- PLAY <song>

- Wrap behaviors in LUA or Python

- Attach behaviors to fixures and allow easy selection from UI
