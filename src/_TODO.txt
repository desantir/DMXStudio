TODO ------------------------------------------------------------------------ TODO

	L Scene Animations:
		L Movement animation travel time
		L Programs should control travel time rather than fixed signal input
		L Global animations or attached to a fixture
		L Animation speed changes based on beat detection
		L Multiple animations per fixture (deal with channel contention)
		L Pixel Map support (single/multiple fixtures)
		L Sine wave movement
		L Loadable, scripted, self contained animations with specific properties (versus the current rat's nest)

	L Sound processing
		M Beat detector scaling, better detection algorithm, logarithmic scaling
		L Add channel mixing to audio stream class
		L Support format conversion in audio output
		H Much better sound animation affects (currently they are not very exact and are hard to setup)

	M Fixtures / Fixture Definitions
		L Simple angle->value options (angle*xx) == DMX code
		L Multiple universes (increase DMX packet size, zero-based universe ID is simply the high byte)
		L Movement speed abstraction
		L Add fixture icon images
		L Dimmer curve (LEDs can fall off fast at the end)
		L Editable fixture defaults
		L Minimum dimmer setting

	M Code Maintainence
		M Bullet proof error detection and automatic restart
		H Comments - doxygen?
		L Introduce studio fault to kill and restart program (vs error based execeptions)
		M Unit tests

	L Scene / Chase Improvements
		L Scene selection based on the music beat (BPM)
		L Chase changed based on beat, time or track transition
		L Chase random scene from all/pool
		L Chase crossfade = % of time cues fading into each other (kill fade time change to crossfade model)?

	L General Enhancements
		L MIDI fogger control with ready indicator (auto fog timer?)
		L Midi controller support ( tablet support )
		L Fixture duty cycle support?
		L Video support

	H Full User Interface
		H Full access GUI (definition, control, etc)
		H HTTP server / REST protocol (what about taps and audio display?)
		L Auto color set RGBAW channels from palette, HSV? UI issue?
		L Game engine such as http://www.panda3d.org/ for lighting simulation?
		  MS XNA? http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff827897.aspx
	
 	M Test Targets
		Verify channel remapping works across UI, ACTORS, and ANIMATIONS 
			Seems possible to double map or not map scene actor channels
			Check UI->SceneChannelAnimator and SceneMovementAnimator->SceneChannelAnimator
