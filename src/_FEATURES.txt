Scene
	// FixtureInstance(s)
		// Fixture ID
		// ChannelInfo

Group
	// Physical fixtures(s)

Chase
	// Scene(s) (repeatable - yikes! - with local delay)
	// Delay
	// Fade
	// Triggers (tap, audio, etc);

Animations
	// Scene animations/effects Apply to all / select
		// Sequence fixtures (with delay)
		// Fade in/out (with sound level immediate/moving average)
		// Generic channel(s) change over time
		// on/off groups of fixtures (with delay, fade) bank A on / bank B off / bank A off / bank B on
		// On/off with beat detection
		// Dimmer based on power / dB
		// Control channel range based on beat or level (gobo shake rate for example)
		// Map beat detector frequency level and/or beat to fixture and channel
		// Color switching to beat/sound level
			// Faster switching on high level
			// Cycle through flashes, static color, switching colors
		// Movement macros 
		Strobe only with setable times
		Laser bean movement animation (move to point, strobe, move, strobe, etc) (use coord movement, strobe fixture setting, off on home return true)
		// Stop reseting channel animation during auto blackout
		Run once channel animations
/*
	workspace:
		- default scene where fixtures can be controlled in real time
		- overrides any scene or chase in effect
		- contents can be written to a scene

	fixture change model:
		- ui adds pf channel values to actors in the default scene
		- default scene actors can be added to any scene (multiple)
		- default scene actors can be cleared
		- default scene actors cleared automatically when scene is loaded
			- loading a scene starts playing of transitions
		- default scene actors override scene actors
		- can remove individual scene actors (even default)
		- don't need the dmx packet here in venue - load scene just needs a local one (or none)

	scene modification:
		- load scene
		- manually modify 1-n fixtures with control fixture
		- copy fixtures from other scenes
		- select scene update

	scene create:
		- manually modify fixtures and/or load existing scene
		- select scene create with copy
