Key:  Priority L M H (low to high)		Effort   1 2 3 4 5 (easy to hard)

   L Web Full UI - music controller
		H   Implement search for tracks, scenes, and other objects, reduce/remove dialogs used to control track selection
			- Live search jquery control

		M 5 Workspace channel management (re-arrange channels, hidden channels, save channel sets)

        L 1 Mobile UI that can automatically find DMX servers
		L 5 Alternative to dialogs
	    L   Multiple object changes (add act to all, change animation time in all, etc
		L 1 Improved error responses (e.g. "<item> not found")
		L 1 Handle disconnected server state (disable UI, startup errors out if no COM)
		L 2 Authentication & session control
		L 4 Album artwork

	L Sound processing
		H   Beat detector scaling, improved detection algorithm, logarithmic scaling

		L   Other sound analysis for chase track http://www.smartjava.org/content/exploring-html5-web-audio-visualizing-sound
		L   Add channel mixing to audio stream class
		L   Song blending / beat matching
		L   Handle music format changes (must be some event)

	H Animations:
		H 5 Animations shared across scenes and globally defined (need to copy/update across scenes)
				- Define named animations separately from scenes
				- Assign animations to scenes (1-n)
				- If fixture is not in current scene, animation just ignores

		H   Improved sound animation effects (currently they are not very exact and are hard to setup)

		M 5 Simplify animations (must be easier to create animations from the UI)
		M   Incorporate track audio info to music match scene selection

		L   Multiple animations per fixture (deal with channel contention)
		L   Loadable, scripted, self contained animations with specific properties (versus the current rat's nest)

   H Scene / Chase / Act Improvements
		L   Chase crossfade = % of time cues fading into each other (kill fade time change to crossfade model)?
		L   Name acts and easier act selection in UI

	L Fixtures / Fixture Definitions
        H   Palettes for location, color, intensity (fixe whiteout pallet)
		H   Fan channel values in a group

		L   Simple angle->value options (angle*xx) == DMX code
		L   Movement speed abstraction
		L   Park moving heads - stop moving back to home?
            Pan/tilt word size
		L   Controllable master dimmer curve (like H6)

	L General Enhancements
	    M   Read/convert pre-existing fixture metadata files such as Chauvet
		L   MIDI fogger control with ready indicator (auto fog timer?)
		L   Video support
		L   New Spotify C API when available

	L Code Maintainence
		M   Bullet proof error detection and automatic restart
		L   Introduce studio fault to kill and restart program (vs error based execeptions)

IDEA ------------------------------------------------------------------------ IDEA

- Console concepts
	      Mark cue
		  Block cue
	      Tracking vs non tracking
		  Cross fade channel values
		  Bump control single channel value

- Higher level abstraction for fixture behaviors. For Example:
		- ROTATE TO 180
		- PAN TO 180
		- STROBE AT <rate>
		- INTENSITY <intensity>
		- SPECIAL EFFECT <args>
		- PLAY <song>

- Wrap behaviors in LUA or Python

- Attach behaviors to fixures and allow easy selection from UI

	Things we wanted but now don't
		L   Chase random scene from all/pool
		L 1 BPM with chase for music match?
		L   Programs should control travel time rather than fixed signal input
		L   Animation speed changes based on beat detection
		L   Chase changed based on beat, time or track transition
		L 1 Scrolling text plugin for playing track name
		L   Dimmer curve (LEDs can fall off fast at the end)
		L   Minimum dimmer setting
		L   Midi controller support ( tablet support )
		L 5 Positional "map" of fixtures (with icons showing type and direction) for easy capture
