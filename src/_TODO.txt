Key:  Priority L M H (low to high)		Effort   1 2 3 4 5 (easy to hard)

   M Web Full UI - music controller
		M 1 Log into music player
		M 3 Music mapping (Music Scene Select, Map music to scene or chase, Remove music mapping, Show music mappings)

   L Web UI
		H 1 Scrolling text plugin for playing track name
		H 5 Positional "map" of fixtures to allow easy selection
		M 5 Workspace channel management (re-arrange channels, hidden channels, save channel sets)
		m 5 Animation macros (must be easier to create animations from the UI)
		L 5 Alternative to dialogs
		L 5 Alternative to edit/delete mode icon clutter
		L 1 Improved error responses (e.g. "<item> not found")
		L 1 UI Preferences (update frequency etc, collapsed sections, expanded sections)
		L 1 Fixture icon images rather than text (preference)
		L 1 Animated running GIFs for chases
		L 2 Cleanup CSS styles - put in css file
		L 1 Handle disconnected server state (disable UI)
		L 1 Animation Speed
		L 2 All rest edit services are POST
		L 3 Finish refactoring of mobile (re-using all REST services)
		L 2 Authentication & session control
		L 2 Chase beat (follows music) and tap (follows user)
		L 3 Track pan/tilt with mouse
		L 4 Album artwork
		H 4 Music search

	L Scene Animations:
		L Movement animation travel time
		L Programs should control travel time rather than fixed signal input
		L Global animations or attached to a fixture
		L Animation speed changes based on beat detection
		L Multiple animations per fixture (deal with channel contention)
		L Pixel Map support (single/multiple fixtures)
		L Sine wave movement
		L Loadable, scripted, self contained animations with specific properties (versus the current rat's nest)

	L Sound processing
		M Beat detector scaling, improved detection algorithm, logarithmic scaling
		L Add channel mixing to audio stream class
		L Support format conversion in audio output
		H Improved sound animation affects (currently they are not very exact and are hard to setup)
		L Song blending / beat matching

	M Fixtures / Fixture Definitions
		L Simple angle->value options (angle*xx) == DMX code
		L Multiple universes (increase DMX packet size, zero-based universe ID is simply the high byte)
		L Movement speed abstraction
		L Dimmer curve (LEDs can fall off fast at the end)
		L Editable fixture defaults
		L Minimum dimmer setting

	M Code Maintainence
		M Bullet proof error detection and automatic restart
		H Comments - doxygen?
		L Introduce studio fault to kill and restart program (vs error based execeptions)
		M Unit tests

	L Scene / Chase Improvements
		L Scene selection based on the music beat (BPM)
		L Chase changed based on beat, time or track transition
		L Chase random scene from all/pool
		L Chase crossfade = % of time cues fading into each other (kill fade time change to crossfade model)?
		L Chase learn mode - track time and scene transitions

	L General Enhancements
		L MIDI fogger control with ready indicator (auto fog timer?)
		L Midi controller support ( tablet support )
		L Fixture duty cycle support?
		L Video support
	
 	M Test Targets
		Verify channel remapping works across UI, ACTORS, and ANIMATIONS 
			Seems possible to double map or not map scene actor channels
			Check UI->SceneChannelAnimator and SceneMovementAnimator->SceneChannelAnimator
