Key:  Priority L M H (low to high)		Effort   1 2 3 4 5 (easy to hard)

   H Current Priority

   H BUGS
   		H	Very rare Philips Hue driver lpContext invalid sig11 (verify timing too)
		H	Very rare FTDI "freeze" - seems unrelated to studio - can it be detected and reset?
		
   L General Enhancements
		U   Nod/rotate offsets (non-unison)

		L	Full support for white (amber/UV) color channels

        H   Color correct RGB colors representing fixture color states (deal with white and amber channels)
				- With Hue, blues are white, minimal color is visible, G2 build color issues

*		H   Implement search for scenes, and other objects
			- Live search jquery control
			- Replace multiselect where possible with select & filter control
			
			Multiple quick effects on different sets of fixtures
			Separate quick effect selection from slider selection
			Full video analysis for color changes (rather than YouTube storyboard)

		L   Move group of fixtures, grid settings, snap, etc

   L Web Full UI - music controller
		L   Track seek
        L 1 Mobile UI that can automatically find DMX servers (support uPNP)
	    L   Multiple object changes and group movement/align (add act to all, change animation time in all, delete multiple, etc)
		L 2 Authentication

	L Sound processing
*		H   Beat detector scaling, improved detection algorithm, logarithmic scaling

		M   Scale amplitude and dB values to volume or can we get a constant signal?

	H Animations
		M	All basic animation properties should be store in AnimationDefinition as name/value pairs
				- Add DObject name/value pair storage?
		M   Fader support for mixed fixure effects

		L	Channel program needs optional start-up channel(s) set outside of main program (see nod movement for example)
		L   Movement animation's affect of the dimmer channel messing up other animations

    H Scene / Chase / Act Improvements

	L Fixtures / Fixture Definitions
		H   Spread channel values in a group

	L General Enhancements
	    M   Read/convert pre-existing fixture metadata files such as Chauvet

		L   Support video in Music Match (i.e. play specific scene with video)
		L   New Spotify C API for track playback when available

	Things we wanted but now we don't
		M   Track queue/forward/back still seems wonky
		L   Controllable master dimmer curve (like H6) - see Scene FixtureDimmer
		L   Park moving heads - stop moving back to home
            Pan/tilt word size
		L   Handle music format changes (must be some event)
		L   Chase random scene from all/pool
		L 1 BPM with chase for music match?
		L   Programs should control travel time rather than fixed signal input
		L   Animation speed changes based on beat detection
		L   Chase changed based on beat, time or track transition
		L 1 Scrolling text plugin for playing track name
		L   Minimum dimmer setting
		L   Midi controller support ( tablet support )
		L 5 Positional "map" of fixtures (with icons showing type and direction) for easy capture
		M 5 Workspace channel management (re-arrange channels, hidden channels, save channel sets)
		M   Incorporate track audio info to music match scene selection
		- Wrap behaviors in LUA or Python
		- Attach behaviors to fixures and allow easy selection from UI (palettes should do this)
		L   Song blending / beat matching
		L   Add channel mixing to audio stream class
		M   Bullet proof error detection and automatic restart
		L   Introduce studio fault to kill and restart program (vs error based execeptions)
		L   Chase crossfade = % of time cues fading into each other (kill fade time change to crossfade model)?
*		L   Other sound analysis for chase track http://www.smartjava.org/content/exploring-html5-web-audio-visualizing-sound
		L   Loadable, scripted, self contained animations with specific properties
		L   Name acts and easier act selection in UI
		L   Multiple animations per fixture (deal with channel contention)
			- perhaps each animation has  priority and are ordered by priority?
			- in priority order, animation suggest a channel value? Pulse after color changer for exmple
			- reason: animations only deal with specific channels or channel types
		L	Video preview window
				L   Simple angle->value options (angle*xx) == DMX code
		L   Movement speed abstraction
