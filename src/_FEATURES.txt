Animations
	// Scene animations/effects Apply to all / select
		// Sequence fixtures (with delay)
		// Fade in/out (with sound level immediate/moving average)
		// Generic channel(s) change over time
		// on/off groups of fixtures (with delay, fade) bank A on / bank B off / bank A off / bank B on
		// On/off with beat detection
		// Dimmer based on power / dB
		// Control channel range based on beat or level (gobo shake rate for example)
		// Map beat detector frequency level and/or beat to fixture and channel
		// Color switching to beat/sound level
			// Faster switching on high level
			// Cycle through flashes, static color, switching colors
		// Movement macros 
		Strobe only with setable times
		Laser bean movement animation (move to point, strobe, move, strobe, etc) (use coord movement, strobe fixture setting, off on home return true)
		// Stop reseting channel animation during auto blackout
		Run once channel animations

Selectable audio input ( listener, mic, none )
Sound level animations (level, freq) need modifiers to make more effective
Global sound fade
Andriod Remote control (simple - blackout, select scene, select chase )
Whiteout mode with on/off/strobe
Log to file
Convert to server, text UI is server UI??
Fixture initial channel values (set when adding)
DMXStudio INI file (start http server, threads, whiteout strobe timings, etc)
Cross scene home position (stop pan/tilt re-seek to home)
Multiple personality fixtures (i.e. 3, 5, 9 channels) (multiple definitions that are consolidated in the UI per fixture)
Dimmer channel: Arbitrary ranges, any channel can be a dimmer,  high/low any order, all suported by animations

/*
	workspace:
		- default scene where fixtures can be controlled in real time
		- overrides any scene or chase in effect
		- contents can be written to a scene

	fixture change model:
		- ui adds pf channel values to actors in the default scene
		- default scene actors can be added to any scene (multiple)
		- default scene actors can be cleared
		- default scene actors cleared automatically when scene is loaded
			- loading a scene starts playing of transitions
		- default scene actors override scene actors
		- can remove individual scene actors (even default)
		- don't need the dmx packet here in venue - load scene just needs a local one (or none)

	scene modification:
		- load scene
		- manually modify 1-n fixtures with control fixture
		- copy fixtures from other scenes
		- select scene update

	scene create:
		- manually modify fixtures and/or load existing scene
		- select scene create with copy
