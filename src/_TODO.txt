Key:  Priority L M H (low to high)		Effort   1 2 3 4 5 (easy to hard)

	H Scene Animations:
		H   All animations should be shared across scenes and globally defined
		H   Animations are scene-based and do not track well across chase sequences
		H   Animations are not processed during chase cross fade
		H   Improved sound animation affects (currently they are not very exact and are hard to setup)

		M 5 Simplify animations (must be easier to create animations from the UI)
		M   Incorporate track info to music match scene selection

		L   Movement animation travel time (prefetch next scene/position)
		L   Programs should control travel time rather than fixed signal input
		L   Animation speed changes based on beat detection
		L   Multiple animations per fixture (deal with channel contention)
		L   Loadable, scripted, self contained animations with specific properties (versus the current rat's nest)

	H Scene / Chase / Act Improvements
		L 1 BPM with chase for music match?
		L   Chase changed based on beat, time or track transition
		L   Chase random scene from all/pool
		L   Chase crossfade = % of time cues fading into each other (kill fade time change to crossfade model)?
		L   Name acts and easier act selection in UI
		L   Other sound analysis for chase scene http://www.smartjava.org/content/exploring-html5-web-audio-visualizing-sound

   L Web Full UI - music controller
		H 3 Use events to drive UI updates not polling

		M 5 Workspace channel management (re-arrange channels, hidden channels, save channel sets)

		L 1 Scrolling text plugin for playing track name
		L 5 Positional "map" of fixtures (with icons showing type and direction) for easy capture
		L 5 Alternative to dialogs
		L 1 Improved error responses (e.g. "<item> not found")
		L 1 Handle disconnected server state (disable UI, startup errors out if no COM)
		L 2 Authentication & session control
		L 4 Album artwork
		L 4 Music search

	L Sound processing
		H   Beat detector scaling, improved detection algorithm, logarithmic scaling

		L   Add channel mixing to audio stream class
		L   Song blending / beat matching
		L   Handle music format changes (must be some event)

	L Fixtures / Fixture Definitions
        H   Palettes for location, color, intensity
		H   Fan channel values in a group

		L   Simple angle->value options (angle*xx) == DMX code
		L   Movement speed abstraction
		L   Dimmer curve (LEDs can fall off fast at the end)
		L   Minimum dimmer setting
		L   Park moving heads - stop moving back to home?
            Pan/tilt word size

	L General Enhancements
		L   MIDI fogger control with ready indicator (auto fog timer?)
		L   Midi controller support ( tablet support )
		L   Video support
		?   Need real color transforms

	L Code Maintainence
		M   Bullet proof error detection and automatic restart
		L   Introduce studio fault to kill and restart program (vs error based execeptions)

	? Concepts
	      Mark cue
		  Block cue
	      Tracking vs non tracking
		  Cross fade channel values
		  Bump control single channel value

- Higher level abstraction for fixture behaviors. For Example:
		- ROTATE TO 180
		- PAN TO 180
		- STROBE AT <rate>
		- INTENSITY <intensity>
		- SPECIAL EFFECT <args>
		- PLAY <song>

- Wrap behaviors in LUA or Python

- Attach behaviors to fixures and allow easy selection from UI
